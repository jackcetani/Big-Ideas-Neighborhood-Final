## Which neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the best for kids?

Our goal is to use three Pittsburgh data sets to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh for kids. We will be using the parks, education, and police incident data sets (linked below). Using these metrics we can determine an overall score for each neighborhood, as well as the best one for kids.

In conclusion...
## Regent Square is the best Pittsburgh neighborhood for kids!
